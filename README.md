## OVERVIEW

* The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow to predict the success of funding applications for Alphabet Soup, a charity organization. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify whether a funding application will be successful or not based on various input features.

## RESULTS

 ## Data Preprocessing:

* Target Variable: The target variable for the model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which indicates whether the funding application was successful or not.
* Feature Variables: The features for the model include various columns such as "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS," and "ASK_AMT." 
* Variables to be Removed: The "EIN" and "NAME" columns are removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.

 ## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
.

* Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions: The selected model architecture includes two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively. The activation function used for the hidden layers is "relu," which helps introduce non-linearity and captures complex patterns in the data. The output layer uses the "sigmoid" activation function to produce a binary classification result.
* Target Model Performance: The target model performance was set to achieve an accuracy higher than 75%.
* Steps to Increase Model Performance: Several steps were taken to improve the model performance:
Data preprocessing: Binning rare occurrences in the "APPLICATION_TYPE" and "CLASSIFICATION" columns to reduce the number of unique values.
Increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers to capture more complex patterns in the data.
Adjusting the number of epochs to find the optimal balance between training time and model accuracy.
Optimizing the learning rate to control the convergence speed and avoid overshooting the optimal solution.

## SUMMARY

* The deep learning model developed for Alphabet Soup showed promising results in predicting the success of funding applications. By implementing various optimizations, such as adjusting the number of neurons, epochs, and learning rate, the model's performance was improved. However, despite these efforts, the final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72-73%, which did not meet the target accuracy of 75%. Although the model did not reach the desired accuracy level, it still provides valuable insights into the factors influencing funding success and can be used as a starting point for further improvements or alternative modeling approaches

## Recommendation

* To further enhance the model's performance, it is recommended to explore alternative model architectures or algorithms. One possible approach is to try different types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), depending on the nature of the input data. These models are specifically designed to capture spatial or temporal patterns, respectively, and may be more suitable for certain types of data. Additionally, ensemble methods, such as random forests or gradient boosting, can be considered to combine multiple models and improve prediction accuracy.

* By experimenting with different model architectures and algorithms, Alphabet Soup can continue to refine their funding application prediction system and make more informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources to maximize the impact of their charitable activities.
